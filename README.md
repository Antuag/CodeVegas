# 🎰 Casino Project - Programming Techniques 2025-1

This project will simulate a text-based casino application, developed as part of the Programming Techniques course. The project will follow a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** structure without object-oriented programming, using only basic Python features such as lists, dictionaries, functions, and modules.

## 📌 Project Overview

The main goal is to create a functional and organized casino system where users can register, play various games, and view personal statistics. The project will implement file handling, recursion, backtracking, and classic algorithmic techniques like sorting and searching.

---

## 🧱 Planned Features

- User registration, editing, and deletion
- Four fully functional mini-games:
  - Slot Machine
  - Blackjack (simplified)
  - Betting System (with backtracking)
- Statistics and history reports
- Game queue simulation using stacks and queues
- Algorithms:
  - Sorting: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge
  - Searching: Linear and Binary
  - Recursion and Backtracking for decision logic
 
👥 Team Planning
The project will be developed by a team of 3 members

Tasks will be divided logically (user system, games, reports, etc.)

All members will collaborate and review each other's work

Games will be developed and tested independently, then integrated

🧠 Algorithms & Techniques
We will implement and explore the following:

Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort

Searching Algorithms: Linear Search and Binary Search

Recursion: Used in decision-making and game logic

Backtracking: Used for optimal choices in betting games

Stacks & Queues: Used to manage game turns and player history

🧪 Testing Plan
Before the final delivery, the project will be tested with:

At least 3 users

Each game tested by multiple users

Fully functional menu navigation and data saved in JSON
